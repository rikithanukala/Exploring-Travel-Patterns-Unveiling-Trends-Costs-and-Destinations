5122 Final App
Introduction
Understanding travel patterns is critical for travelers, businesses, and policymakers to make informed decisions. This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of travel trends, including popular destinations, transportation preferences, and travel costs.

By visualizing key metrics and trends, users can explore:
	•	Which destinations are most frequently visited.
	•	The most cost-effective travel options.
	•	Seasonal trends in travel patterns.
	•	Areas or modes of transportation to avoid based on cost or popularity.

The goal is to empower users with actionable insights from a travel dataset and enhance decision-making in the tourism industry.

Data/Operation Abstraction Design
The dataset includes trip details like dates, destinations, transportation types, and costs. Missing values were replaced or interpolated, and transportation types were standardized. Using Streamlit, dynamic filters for year, destination, and transportation type enable interactive trend analysis. Visualizations, including line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and maps, were created with Plotly for enhanced user experience.

Future Work
In the future I aim to integrate APIs for real-time travel data, user-uploaded datasets, 3D and layered visualizations, and mobile optimization. Adding user accounts for personalized recommendations and connecting with platforms like Expedia will provide a seamless experience. These upgrades aim to make the app a comprehensive travel analytics tool.
